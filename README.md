my internship period works on bci


RFC (Record Filter Classifier)
*rfc_main.py : main application file, Run the application from here.
*rfc_genFunction : general function file.
*rfc_markerUI : Experiment UI file, the ui that will appear when you start recording the experiment

* Note that the "rfc_main.py" has to be run together with lsl streaming (or UI won't appear). In my application, i use Unicorn EEG lsl, streaming through OpenViBE Aquisition Server and Designer.
